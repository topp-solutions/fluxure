# This template contains all of the possible sections and their default values

# Note that all fields that take a lint level have these possible values:
# * deny - An error will be produced and the check will fail
# * warn - A warning will be produced, but the check will not fail
# * allow - No warning or error will be produced, though in some cases a note
# will be

# The values provided in this template are the default values that will be used
# when any section or field is not specified in your own configuration

# Root options

# The graph table configures how the dependency graph is constructed and thus
# which crates the checks are performed against
[graph]
# If true, metadata will be collected with `--all-features`. Note that this can't
# be toggled off if true, if you want to conditionally enable `--all-features` it
# is recommended to pass `--all-features` on the cmd line instead
all-features = true
